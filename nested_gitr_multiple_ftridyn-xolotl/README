For running this test, copy the content to a folder in $SCRATCH. Otherwise there might be issues with netcdf when running GITR.
The test should easily be completed in 30min (debug queue), using 8 nodes.

This test runs F-TRIDYN+GITR for ITER, assuming a D+He plasma, with additional Be and Ne impurities (for erosion, not transport). 
Then the workflow runs 2 instances of F-TRIDYN+Xolotl, reading input from gitrOut_0.txt and gitrOut_1.txt. As defined in ips.ftx.config,
we assume 90% D - 10% He plasma with additional 5% Be and Ne, which are only accounted for sputtering, not implantation.

A reduced version of the network is used in these examples (maxV=20, instead of maxV=50).

While waiting for GITR to be ready, all species (except W) have a fixed impact energy (250eV) and angle (normal). This will be 
changed to read from gitrOut.txt
