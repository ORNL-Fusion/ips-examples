! There are two ways to allocate the plasma state arrays for the FUS component:
!
! 1) If an input_state_file is specified in the /static_state_data/ namelist,
!    that file is read as an aux state file and the FUS component data is merged to the current
!    plasma state.  If that input file is properly initialized then the current state will
!    inherit a complete set of FUS data and allocated arrays.  The models must then work with
!    the allocated array sizes - including everthing dimensioned by nrho_fus

Data for this method is in directory init_from_input_state 

!
! 2) If no input_state_file is specified (input_state_file = ' ') , it is assumed that this is part of
!    a normal initialization sequence in which the EPA has set the arrays assiciated with
!    the NB species.  This includes nspec_fusion and the FUS species arrays dimensioned with it.
!
!    This model component then specifies nrho_fus and proceeds to allocate and initialize
!    all the variables dimensioned by nrho_fus:
!
!      nrho_fus, rho_fus(nrho_fus), nfusi(nrho_fus-1,nspec_fus), pfuse(nrho_fus-1),
!      pfusi(nrho_fus-1), epll_fusi(nrho_fus-1,nspec_fus), eperp_fusi(nrho_fus-1, nspec_fus),
!      curfusn(nrho_fus-1)


Data for this method is in init_from_cur_state
