! There are two ways to allocate the plasma state arrays for the NB component:
!
! 1) If an input_state_file is specified in the /static_state_data/ namelist,
!    that file is read as an aux state file and the NB component data is merged to the current
!    plasma state.  If that input file is properly initialized then the current state will
!    inherit a complete set of NB data and allocated arrays.  The models must then work with
!    the allocated array sizes - i.e. including everything dimensioned by nrho_nbi

Data for this method is in directory init_from_input_state 

!
! 2) If no input_state_file is specified (input_state_file = ' ') , it is assumed that this is part of
!    a normal initialization sequence in which the EPA has set the arrays associated with
!    the beam sources i.e. everthing dimensioned by nbeam:

!       nbeam, nbi_src_name(nbeam), power_nbi(nbeam), nspec_beam(nbeam),
!       nbion(nbeam), kvolt_nbi(nbeam), nspec_beam and the NB species arrays.

!    This model component then specifies nrho_nbi and proceeds to allocate and initialize
!    all the variables dimensioned by nrho_nbi:
!
!      nrho_nbi, rho_nbi(nrho_nbi), nbeami(nrho_nbi-1,nspec_beam), pbe(nrho_nbi-1),
!      pbi(nrho_nbi-1), epll_beami(nrho_nbi-1,nspec_beam),
!      eperp_beami(nrho_nbi-1, nspec_beam)

Data for this method is in init_from_cur_state
