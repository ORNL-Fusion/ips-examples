nput files for this cql3d example are too big to go into github.  Besides which
some of them are binary.  So temporarily I'm moving them to my project area on Edison
/project/projectdirs/atom/users/dbb/cql3d_input.  To run this example you
will need to copy the contents of that directory here.  It's not satisfactory but 
until we find a better solution ...
