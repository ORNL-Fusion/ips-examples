# Brief description
A CQL3D stand alone example that runs CQL3D in the IPS, and that communicates through the
Plasma State.  It is a rather complicated example that comes from work on iteration of 
TORLH and CQL3D. 

#Caveat (temproray I expect)
The input files for this cql3d example are too big to go into github.  Besides which
some of them are binary.  So temporarily I'm moving them to my project area on Edison
/project/projectdirs/atom/users/dbb/cql3d_input.  To run this example you
will need to copy the contents of that directory here.  It's not satisfactory but 
until we find a better solution ...
