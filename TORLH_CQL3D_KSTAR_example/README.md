# TORLH_CQL3D_KSTAR_example
An example that couples the full wave Lower hybrid code TORLH with the CQL3D Fokker-Planck
code with thermal profile data communicated through the Plasma State system.  It is a 
rather complicated example in that several auxiliary codes are also invoked by the component
wrappers.  A code that generates the quasilinear operator data from the field solution
provided by TORLH, and a code that generates the dissipative part of the conductivity tensor
needed by TORLH from the non-Maxwellian distribution generated by CQL3D.

Nota Bene:  There are fortran executables in the IPS wrappers directory that must be built
after cloning, i.e. those in torlh_cql3d_iterate and ips-model-epa.


##  Caveat (temporay I expect)
Some of the IPS examples have input files that are big and/or binary and therefore should
not go not the github repo.  Also we don't yet have a maintained collection of physics
executables.  Therefore I'm collecting the inputs and executables for the examples in a
directory in my project area -> /project/projectdirs/atom/users/dbb/IPS_examples_externals
The files for this particular example are in the subdirectory:

/project/projectdirs/atom/users/dbb/IPS_examples_externals/TORLH_CQL3D_KSTAR_example_ext

It's not very satisfactory but until we find a better solution ...
