  wghta = 20.

  nzones = 20
      !! number of radial zones (equally spaced in sqrt(tor.flux))
      !! this determines the grid for calculation of 1d outputs
      !! such as Pbe and Pbi.
      !! NOTE: not included in Plasma_State_Input, because this
      !! value is used to **set** the plasma state rho_nbi grid.
  
  nzone_fb = 10
      !! number of radial zones in 4d fast ion distributions
      !! (r,theta,E,vpll/v).  nzones should be an integer multiple
      !! of nzone_fb; if not, nzone_fb is increased until this
      !! condition is satisfied, or if this is not possible,
      !! nzone_fb=nzones is imposed.
  
  nznbme = 75
      !! number of energy zones for fast ion distribution functions
      !! Plasma State data determines Emax for beam species; for fusion
      !! products an appropriate Emax is chosen based on the fusion
      !! reaction(s) that provide the source.
  
  nznbma = 50
      !! number of pitch angle zones for distribution functions
      !! this is the same for all NUBEAM fast ion species
  
      !! nlfbmflr = 0
      !! FALSE (0): accumulate fbm @ guiding center (usually preferable)
      !! TRUE (1): accumulate fbm @ ptcl position (NOTE: a future version
      !! of NUBEAM will always accumulate both variants.  When this is
      !! done, this switch will no longer be needed).

      !! orbit timestep control (replacing DTN):  accuracy criterion 
      !!  "per bounce" for orbit integration.
      !!  The code interprets this somewhat conservatively, and the default
      !!  value of 1.0e-3 is usually sufficient.  Reducing this to 1.0e-4
      !!  will slow the code (NUBEAM) significantly and in standard regression
      !!  tests there aren't any other change in observable outputs.

  nlfatom = 0

      !! leave this switch alone).

  ! sawtooth model:
  ! by default, a standard "Kadomtsev" mixing model is applied.
  !             "Porcelli" variants can be requested using switches
  !             nmix_kdsaw and fporcelli.  Model must be selected
  !             at INIT time.

  ! ad hoc "fish bone" and "ripple loss" models also exist;

  ! anomalous fast ion transport can be requested through the plasma state.
