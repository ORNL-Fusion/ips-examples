  ! activation of sawtooth model:
  ! sawtooth mixing should be precomputed if there is a chance that a
  ! sawtooth will occur within the next NUBEAM time step.  To apply sawtooth
  ! mixing at step N, it must have been precomputed at step N-1.

  sawflag = 0   ! set =1 to apply previously computed sawtooth mixing
